## Heindrich Himmler Macalinao
I am a second-year Computer Science student at New Era University, interested in AI development and data science. I enjoy working with Java and Python, and I’m someone who can debug for long hours to solve problems efficiently.

I am currently learning SQL through IBM Db2 while strengthening my skills in Java programming. I focus on improving my understanding of software development, databases, and analytical thinking.

I am also a DOST Merit Scholar and the current Secretary of the Association of Computer Science Students (ACSS) at New Era University, I aim to combine academic growth with leadership and service in the field of computing.

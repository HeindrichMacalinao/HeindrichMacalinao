# Hey there, I'm Heindrich 👋

## Heindrich Himmler Macalinao
I am a second-year Computer Science student at New Era University, interested in AI development and data science. I enjoy working with Java and Python, and I’m someone who can debug for long hours to solve problems efficiently.

I am currently improving my Java skills while taking courses in Object-Oriented Programming, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Networking and Communications, Automata Theory and Formal Languages, Modeling and Simulation, and Advanced Statistics.

I am also a DOST Merit Scholar and the current Secretary of the Association of Computer Science Students (ACSS) at New Era University. I aim to combine academic growth with leadership and service in the field of computer science.
